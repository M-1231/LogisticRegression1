    "Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression (and other machine learning models) to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and small fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns. Regularization helps by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from assigning too much importance to certain features or from having excessively large parameter values. There are two common types of regularization used in logistic regression: L1 regularization and L2 regularization.\n",
